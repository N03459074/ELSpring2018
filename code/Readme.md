**Pi Camera Project**

HARDWARE Requirements:
- Raspberry pi 3
- Pi camera
- pan tilt servo motor setup  
  ** As defined in 'app.py', the pan servo is connected to GPIO pin 17, and the tilt servo is connected to GPIO pin 4.
 If you chose to use another set of pins, these values must be changed in 'app.py'. (The wiring diagram for the pi can be viewed in the README.md in the 'doc' directory.

SOFTWARE Setup:  
   1. Clone git repo
   2. Install all system and python requirements noted in requirements.txt
   3. Enable the pi camera
   4. Setup:
      - cd to your working project directory
      - Within working directory, create a directory called 'static' to hold the pictures that will be taken
      - Run 'python3 createPicTable.py' (make sure to set the path to your database as your preferred location)
      - Run 'python3 app.py' to host website on localhost:8080 (again, make sure to edit path for database connection)
      - Open your browser to localhost:8080 to view site
