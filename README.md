### **__Pi Camera Project__**  
__Goal__  
The goal of this project was to design a camera mechanism controlled by a web interface. This mechanism had to allow the camera to be rotated both vertically and horizontally. The web interface needed to be able to move the camera mechanism in a controlled fashion, take a still picture at any point, store pictures with timestamps, and allow users to view all pictures taken. 

__What was acheived__  
All goals stated above were acheived through the course of working on this project. Work was split evenly among group members.  
Emily Venuto (50% of the work):  
- Design web interface
- Code camera functionality to take pictures from the website
- Set up the database to hold pictures and timestamps
- Allow pictures to be viewed through the web interface

Philip Leung (50% of the work):  
- Code functionality to control both servo motors from the web interface
- Assemble the pan-tilt servo mechanism
- Wire the pi-servo mechanism

__Usability__  
If you wish to re-create this project, you will be able to do so by following the instructions in the README.md in the code directory.
